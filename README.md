# Catastrophic_Events_Project
For this database project, we have decided to gather information on past catastrophic
events around the world and design a database around that. A catastrophic event can include
natural disasters and even disasters resulting from acts of terrorism; the broad definition would
be any significant event that resulted in catastrophic consequences such as severe infrastructural
damages, high injury rate, and high mortality rate. A catastrophic event can include natural
disasters, pandemics, and even disasters resulting from acts of terrorism, however, for this
project we kept it limited to natural disasters.  The database will include information on the type
of event (i.e. earthquake, hurricane, volcano, etc...), the location affected by the disaster, the
severity of the event measured by the appropriate scale (Richter scale, Fujita scale, etc...), and
the timeframe that even was active.
